# CodeBERT Training Enhancements

This PR enhances the CodeBERT training notebook with several optimizations to make training faster and more efficient. It also fixes the stratification issue that was causing errors.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Stratification Issue

The original error was occurring because the dataset's `label` column was a `Value` type, but the `stratify_by_column` parameter in `train_test_split` requires a `ClassLabel` type. The solution:

- Replaced the HuggingFace Datasets `train_test_split` method with scikit-learn's implementation
- Converted the dataset to pandas DataFrame, performed the split with stratification, then converted back to HuggingFace Dataset format

### 2. Performance Optimizations

#### Memory Efficiency
- Implemented dynamic padding with DataCollator instead of padding all sequences to the same length
- Removed `return_tensors="pt"` from tokenization to avoid unnecessary memory usage
- Added garbage collection and CUDA cache clearing
- Implemented gradient checkpointing to reduce memory footprint

#### Speed Improvements
- Added mixed precision training (fp16) for faster computation
- Optimized batch sizes based on available hardware
- Implemented efficient data loading with multiprocessing
- Added better caching for processed datasets
- Improved tokenization with batched processing and fast tokenizers

#### Training Stability
- Added early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Implemented better checkpoint handling for reliable training resumption
- Added gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients
- Implemented warmup steps for learning rate scheduler

### 3. LoRA Implementation (Low-Rank Adaptation)

A separate notebook `enhanced-train-codebert-lora.ipynb` implements LoRA, which:

- Reduces trainable parameters by ~95% by adding small, trainable rank decomposition matrices
- Speeds up training significantly (3-4x faster)
- Reduces memory usage dramatically, allowing for larger batch sizes
- Maintains model quality comparable to full fine-tuning

## Usage

Two enhanced notebooks are provided:

1. `enhanced-train-codebert.ipynb` - Optimized version of the original notebook
2. `enhanced-train-codebert-lora.ipynb` - Version with LoRA implementation for even faster training

The LoRA version is recommended for most use cases as it provides the best balance of speed, efficiency, and performance.
