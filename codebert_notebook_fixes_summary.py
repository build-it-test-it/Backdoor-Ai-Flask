# TPU-related fixes
print_section("TPU Configuration Fixes")

print_fix(
    "TPU Misconfiguration",
    "Added a dedicated function 'detect_and_configure_accelerator()' to properly detect and "
    "configure TPU. Imported torch_xla libraries and set up XLA device configuration."
)

print_fix(
    "Trainer Misconfiguration for TPU",
    "Updated TrainingArguments with TPU-specific parameters including tpu_num_cores=8, "
    "dataloader_drop_last=True for TPU compatibility, and optimized batch sizes for TPU."
)

print_fix(
    "Metadata Accelerator Misconfiguration",
    "Added proper metadata for TPU accelerator in the training arguments and "
    "configured TPU-specific parameters based on detected hardware."
)

print_fix(
    "Incomplete TPU-Specific Optimizations",
    "Added TPU-specific optimizations including XLA configuration, optimized batch sizes, "
    "and proper data loading strategies for TPU."
)

print_fix(
    "No Handling for TPU Memory Constraints",
    "Implemented gradient accumulation steps and configured memory-efficient training "
    "options based on the detected hardware (TPU, GPU, or CPU)."
)

print_fix(
    "Missing Logging for TPU Progress",
    "Added TPU-specific logging and progress tracking with tqdm progress bars "
    "for tokenization and other long-running operations."
)

# Data processing fixes
print_section("Data Processing Fixes")

print_fix(
    "Potential Label Imbalance",
    "Added detection and warning for label imbalance with imbalance ratio calculation. "
    "Implemented stratified sampling for train/test split to maintain label distribution."
)

print_fix(
    "Inefficient Tokenization Memory Usage",
    "Removed 'return_tensors=\"pt\"' from the tokenize_function to prevent memory issues "
    "when used with dataset.map(). Added batched processing with progress bars."
)

print_fix(
    "Missing Data Collator for Dynamic Padding",
    "Added DataCollatorWithPadding for efficient batching and dynamic padding, which "
    "improves training efficiency and reduces memory usage."
)

print_fix(
    "No Verification of Dataset Size or Structure",
    "Added verification of dataset structure and column names with the verify_dataset_structure() "
    "function. Added warnings for large datasets that might cause memory issues."
)

print_fix(
    "Unverified Dataset Column Names",
    "Added validation of dataset column names and implemented error handling for missing columns "
    "to prevent runtime errors during training."
)

# Error handling and reliability fixes
print_section("Error Handling and Reliability Fixes")

print_fix(
    "Lack of Error Handling in Critical Steps",
    "Added comprehensive try-except blocks around critical operations including dataset loading, "
    "model loading, tokenization, and evaluation to provide meaningful error messages."
)

print_fix(
    "Insufficient Evaluation Sampling",
    "Improved evaluation sampling by implementing stratified sampling to ensure examples from "
    "each class are included. Increased the number of evaluation samples from 5 to 20."
)

print_fix(
    "Dropbox Upload Reliability",
    "Added validation of Dropbox credentials before attempting uploads. Implemented retry logic "
    "for uploads and chunked uploading for large files with progress tracking."
)

print_fix(
    "Deprecated evaluation_strategy Parameter",
    "Updated from 'evaluation_strategy=\"epoch\"' to 'evaluation_strategy=\"steps\"' and added "
    "eval_steps parameter for more frequent and controlled evaluation."
)

print_fix(
    "No Retry Logic for Dataset Loading",
    "Implemented load_dataset_with_retry() function with configurable retry attempts and "
    "delay between retries to handle transient network issues."
)

print_fix(
    "No Checkpoint Recovery Mechanism",
    "Added find_latest_checkpoint() function to detect existing checkpoints and resume training "
    "from the latest checkpoint if training was interrupted."
)

print_fix(
    "Potential Overwriting of Model Files",
    "Added checks before overwriting files and implemented timestamped directories to avoid "
    "overwriting existing model files. Added verification of saved model files."
)

# Additional improvements
print_section("Additional Improvements")

print_fix(
    "Training on Entire Dataset",
    "Ensured the model is trained on the entire dataset by removing any dataset size limitations "

print_section("Conclusion")
print("""
All identified issues have been fixed in the train-codebert-fixed.ipynb notebook.
The notebook now properly handles TPU configuration, includes comprehensive error handling,
optimizes memory usage, and implements best practices for model training and evaluation.

The model is now trained on the entire dataset with proper handling of potential issues
like label imbalance, memory constraints, and hardware-specific optimizations.
